title: Terrorism, Lies, and Losing Faith in My Government

<i>I originally wrote this for a school assignment, but with the fiasco of the Data Rentention and Investigatory Powers Act being shoved through Parliament, I felt it might to appropriate to publish this here.</i>

That was written circa 1946 by Martin Niemöller, describing how the Nazis gradually removed anyone they didn’t like from their society. Alarmingly, though, I’ve been becoming more and more aware of how it still applies to the world we live in today.

I visit the Guardian’s website, and open an article titled “[Isis threat justifies greater surveillance powers in UK, says Liam Fox](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/22/surveillance-powers-liam-fox-isis)”. It’s a short article reporting a couple of paragraphs spoken by a decreasingly relevant politician I’d never heard of before, but that doesn’t stop it triggering very strong emotions in me.

I take to Twitter to broadcast my opinion. I like my voice to be heard - keeping an opinion all to myself doesn’t accomplish very much. I like Twitter a lot because it makes it easy and efficient for my thoughts to be heard by anybody who cares to read them. It is both a meritocratic soapbox and a egalitarian discussion platform at the same time, it has already had momentous impact on modern democracy. During the Arab Spring, Twitter allowed activists to quickly circulate important information and opinion. Instant mass communication played a very significant role in the removal of some of the world’s most oppressive regimes.

Government surveillance has been subject to heavy scrutiny since Edward Snowden leaked confidential documents describing the mass surveillance programmes operated by the USA’s NSA and the UK’s GCHQ. The public finally became aware that it is not just other countries, not just terrorists, that were being spied on by their government - but themselves. Governments have quietly been recording the activities of every one of their unsuspecting citizens for a long time.

Right from the start, there was a lot of contention over whether it was right for Snowden to have leaked the information. From the very start, I sided with Snowden.

The Snowden leaks were when I first became aware of what it means to be whistleblower. The first time I saw the word, I naturally looked it up in a dictionary, and found the following definition.

> a person who informs on a person or organisation engaged in an illicit activity

That raised one more question. Having only a vague idea of its meaning, I looked up _illicit_.

> forbidden by law, rules, or custom

Why then, were politicians insisting that Snowden was not a whistleblower - nothing more than a criminal? A lot of what Snowden reported was clearly illegal (_illicit_), and Snowden had informed on them. For the first time I became aware of one of the many undesirable traits of the politician - trying to change the definition of a word to support their point. Edward Snowden *is* a whistleblower, and unless you want to contest the definition of _whistleblower_ in the Oxford English Dictionary, you cannot disagree with that.

All my life I’d been taught that a democratic government acted according to the will of its constituents, and everything the government did, it did with the support of its citizens. Snowden’s revelations proved that not to be true. They opened my eyes to the world of politics, where every person acts only in their own best interests.

The principle upon which democracy is based is that every elected representative acts on behalf of the people who voted for them. The representative should do what is in their voters’ best interests. Unfortunately, however, this is not how it works in practice.

Snowden’s revelations show governments acting without the consent of their citizens, and, I would argue, without their best interests taking top priority. GCHQ and the NSA are collecting vast amounts of data about every one of their citizens, and they are doing it with the full knowledge, support, and even help of other governments. It’s almost as if there is an elite club where the highest-ranking politicians of our countries all get together and discuss the secret policies and confidential schemes that are *too important* for the average voter to know about.

And how do the political elite justify these unauthorised intrusions into the lives of their residents? Terrorism. By claiming that invasive surveillance is necessary to prevent terrorist attacks, politicians eliminate any opportunity to have a balanced debate. No politician wants to be seen arguing against counter-terrorism measures, lest they be accused of terrorist sympathising and having their carrier ruined.

But I’m not a politician. I’m not going to be checkmated into keeping my mouth closed. I _am_ going to speak out against counter-terrorism measures. Unlike our politicians who should be talking about this, I have the freedom to take the less obvious side of the argument.

Terrorists, as the word implies, use violence to frighten people. As causes of death go, terrorism is pretty low in the overall rankings. It is estimated that four hundred times as many people die in car crashes than in terrorist attacks. But we don’t spend four hundred times as much money on road safety as we do on combating terrorism. And we certainly don’t fear car accidents four hundred times as much as terrorist attacks.

This phenomenon has been noted before. I first heard about this on [an episode of Freakonomics Radio released in 2012](http://freakonomics.com/2012/08/15/whats-more-dangerous-than-a-shark/ "What’s More Dangerous Than a Shark?").

> Human beings are generally quite bad at assessing risks. We tend to get worried about the big anomalous events - shark attacks, for instance… They are scary and they get a lot of news coverage, and then when they get a lot of news coverage, we’re convinced that they’re a lot more common than they are.

This, I think, perfectly describes how our society reacts to terrorism - that is, in exactly the way that terrorists want us to. Terrorists don’t have nearly enough power to kill large amounts of people on a regular basis, or even pretend that they can, but they know that they can safely rely on our media to do their work for them. Of course, terrorists and the media are unlikely to be in cahoots directly, but here is a situation in which the same, terrible goal works out well for both of them. “When we do _x_, we are letting the terrorists win,” is a phrase I have often seen used sarcastically on the Internet, but I will use it sincerely here: when we allow terrorism to be amplified by the media, thus creating terror, we are not just “letting the terrorists win”, __we are doing their work for them__.

We spend billions on counter-terrorism measures, with a lot of that money going into the mass surveillance programmes revealed by Edward Snowden. The most compelling evidence with which to judge their effectiveness is this: when asked to justify their actions to a US government investigation, the NSA (surely the most qualified people to speak on the _pro_ side of this issue) were unable to come up with a single potential incident of terrorism that their surveillance measures managed to prevent or even discourage.

One could argue, as many do, that the very existence of these programmes deters terrorists from launching attacks because of fear that they will be captured, but this argument is ridiculous. Even if you ignore the fact that nobody outside secret agencies or senior government could be sure of the existence of these programmes, this argument is akin to arguing that since you started hunting ghosts, there have been no ghosts haunting your village.

Terrorists have succeeded in their mission to instil fear into the population of our country. Politicians have realised this and are now using the word “terrorism” to justify whatever invasive laws want and prevent a balanced debate. We are living in a culture of fear where nobody dares speak out for fear of being branded “one of them”.

As the quotation I opened this article with shows, this political strategy has been around for a long time, but our current Conservative government are particularly good at it. Another fine example of their expertise in this area can be observed in David Cameron’s justification for his new Internet filters that are soon to be introduced for every Internet user in the UK.

Established under the premise of safeguarding children against widespread and easily accessible online pornography, nationwide Internet filtering goes far beyond that. Soon to be enabled by default by all Internet service providers, the filters prevent access to sites offering sex and relationships education, or support for victims of suicide, domestic abuse or discrimination. And that’s just the start.

The filters also allow the government to block content deemed to be “extremist” in nature. The definition of “extremist” is left intentionally vague, but it is widely assumed by critics of Cameron’s plans to mean “anything the government doesn’t like”. This has already led to online forums, social networking sites, and information about computer security becoming inaccessible for many people, and this is just the start. Who knows what the government might expand its censorship powers to in the future?

If we leave our government to their own devices, we could soon end up with a level of government censorship similar to the so-called “Great Firewall of China”, where anything the ruling party find objectionable is instantly made inaccessible to all of China’s residents.

But David Cameron has branded his attempts at Internet censorship has opt-out porn filters to protect children, making them, like “counter-terrorism” measures, difficult to oppose. Nobody wants to be seen to be supporting making it easier for children to access pornography.

With the Internet filters, it’s even worse, because it’s not just politicians that are affected by the Prime Minister’s manipulative phrasing. While an opt-out switch will exist for Internet filtering, who’s going to check a box that says “Allow me to view porn online”?

First they came for the terrorists.  
Then they came for the pornography viewers.  
And soon they’re coming for me.  
And then they’re coming for you.
