title: Things to check before attending a hackathon
---

Some of these could cause serious problems if you don't check them beforehand.
My plan is to keep this up to date as more hackathon gotchas become apparent.

* [Will I be allowed to sleep?](https://twitter.com/jamesbrks/status/528297506976059392)
* [Do you have a Code of Conduct?](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq)
* [Am I being exploited?](http://jamiemsmyth.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/corporate-hackathons-fine-line-between.html) Check who owns your <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>.
* [Is alcohol being served?](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/alcohol-and-inclusivity-planning-tech-events-with-non-alcoholic-options)
* If I'm legally a child, can I attend? There's often not a clear policy on this. You might need to reach out to the organisers.
* [Will there be power?](https://twitter.com/hubmum/status/366351610949009408) Remember, your laptop can only last so long.

I really welcome input here. Please consider [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/penman/penman.github.com/edit/master/_posts/2014-10-31-prehackathon.md) if you feel you have anything to add.
